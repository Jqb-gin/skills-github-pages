# Motive:
Our ecosystem is complex. having multiple EXEs, multiple websites, multiple tiers of clients, and our own contents creator team. we us developer are kind of responsible for all of that at - if somethig break, we would jump to to help.

Few years ago when we still had our senior in the team, we felt confident enoght to take big steps and as team made a huge changes in our ecosystem. when I joined, the focus was on the custemer's customers and replace most of the UI. year later and the focus goes to the customer's operators, so we automated lot of their work,
like download and uploading recouces, simpler installation prosess and this kind of things.


But the problems started to staking up:

1. We stumble upon errors and edge cases, which introducted complex fixes, like new manual steps for each release.
2. The automated content delivery starts to show its limitations, so we starts to validate it manually.
3. The content team kept relying on us more and more, slowly increasing our responsibilities.

Feels for me like *2 steps forward, 1 step back*, and we got to get that 1 step back, *with TECHNOLEGY!* 🧑‍💻

# The growing tention:
From time to time I stumble upon the frustration of the team members in their effort to keep the automated system stable, and manually reset or resend when something was miss. the content creator team made few mistake here and there that keeps us on our toes, and the content validation steps grow larger.
as of me, it was just too easy to forget a step when publish new release, too many mouse clicks 😣

it was tough to prioritize solution to those things, but that `Lack of trust in the system` hit us in different ways:

Steal time from sprints, it broke our work-life balance for some of us, almost no release because of the overhead, new features was designed from the current `weekly issue` mind set.

we just could not keep up.


# The spark:
My team leader told me I had proven myself to fit as a senior dev, and he wants me to learn to be, and think like Tech Lead and even Architect.
loved to hear that, but it didnt change much, not immediately.

shortly after that, our company annouce: an AI workshop.
I didn't used AI much back then, but i kept trying with the support of out Devops manager and our Arcgitects (love those guys!). for the workshop each team need to bring idea, and use AI as solution or AI as implementor(?).
we splitted to group of 3-4, our idea was to automate some aspects of content validation.
our team include: dev (me), QA, and our team leader. it was fun, the QA explain their pain points and what exactly they validate, and after entire day of coding with AI it gave basis for using AI to write code.
at the end the tool didnt work, apart from writing code, using it in the correct environemnt was beyond my hand, it got low priority and... it never got use.

then we start work on our next big release, for me it was first as senior, and one thing stuck with me:
> I want to help the team. And now it’s literally my job to try.

# The plan:
I started talking to the team from new perspective, trying to identify pain point, and imaging to myself what tools could solve those problems.

I found myselft planing to read books, watching youtube conference video, made few organize my thoughts with ChatGPT conversation to find the correct keywords and brainstorm, and avocating to new tools.

then i write script (using lot of help with AI), and now we have script that automate the manual deployment, and it awesome. sure, AI write a lot of garbage so just wait for the next model, or use different prompt.
now the team talking about daily build!

but the next challange is to ask for time, put price on the task, and talk like the managment wants.
